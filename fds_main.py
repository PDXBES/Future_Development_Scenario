# conditional - test if spreadsheet zones and dev cap zones are comparable
# if no, stop and warn (get list of mismatched)
# if yes, continue
# get empty FdsBLiSCratch table in mem
# append Dev cap fc to that table - map field appropriately
# run pieces in Dave's future_base to update SCratch values
# truncate target (2050, rename to 2070?, or is it just the BO now bc that is 2070?) and then append Scratch values to that
# Update Future Areas (EMGAATS toolbar tool) updates additional fields in 2070/BO
# -----keep this as run manual or incorporate into overall script?
# -----modelers do prob always want to have this bc the model itself changing can create need for update
# archive all inputs and the outputs (I think just the 2070/ BO now)
